# Ideas and quotes from papers

## 25/09/21: Parisutham V. et al & Rober C Brewster. 2025. _E. coli_ transcription factors regulate promoter activity by a universal, homeostatic mechanism.

* On this paper the authors made a method to quantify the translation differences in a plasmid using RT-qPCR. I'm quoting below the method:

This method can be usefull to make swapping promoters and quantify how much each one makes an effect on translation, and then, I can use this as a normalizing factor. 

>***Measuring translation differences for native promoters of SoxS***
The highest constitutive mutant was selected from the promoter library
for decRp, fldAp, and poxBp. The strains were grown as described above
in multiple 300-­ μl wells, pooled at steady state (to a total of 1 ml), OD
was quantified, and cell pellets were frozen overnight. Total RNA was
isolated using the monarch RNA purification kit from NEB following
the manufacturer’s protocol. The resulting RNA was quantified using
nanodrop and 2 ng/μl of total RNA was used in a single-­ step quantita-
tive reverse transcription PCR (RT-­ qPCR) reaction with NEB’s Luna
RT-­ reagent. Separate reactions were set for the YFP and the kanamycin
resistance gene. Both genes are expressed from the same reporter plas-
mid, and the kanamycin resistance gene serves as a housekeeping
control for normalization. Reactions were performed with two biological
and two technical replicates each. Standard curves for both kanamycin
gene and YFP were prepared using the six dilutions of the plasmid.
The concentration of YFP mRNA level was first normalized with the
concentration of kanamycin mRNA and then by the total RNA yield
per OD of the cell. This factor was then used to adjust all the constitu-
tive expressions of the corresponding promoters.
